# UofFly
UofFly is an end to end travel solution which allows students at the University of Illinois — Urbana Champaign to get the most ideal route to get to their homes across the world. 
The app combines the schedules of Peoria Charter Bus Service to Chicago with flights out of O Hare International Airport, Chicago to find the most convenient combination of both. 
Through data analysis, the algorithm ranks flights based on cost, duration and fuel efficiency in the order of importance given by the user.
